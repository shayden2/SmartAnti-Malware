Utilizing VirusTotal API v3 to pull results using the sha256 hash of each file in the train dataset.
For each file:
    - Correct engines are added to a list
    - Incorrect engines are added to another list
    - Engines with unknown decision are added to a third list
    - Data about the file is written to files.txt

Output Files:
    files.txt
        ID
		    SHA256
			Blacklist or Whitelist
            # of engines correct
            # of engines incorrect
            # of engines unknown
	
	engines.txt
	    Name
		    # correct decisions
            # incorrect decisions
            # unknown decisions
			Correct Decision Percentage

We can then see how accurate each virus scanning engine is by calculating the correct decision percentage.

CDP = (num_correct)/(num_correct + num_incorrect + num_unknown)

Engines with highest CDP can be viewed as most trustworthy. Could roll this information into a machine learning model.
